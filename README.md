<h1> Fraud-detection-for-e-commerce-and-bank-transactions</h1>
<h2>Objective</h2>

This project aims to improve the detection of fraud cases for e-commerce transactions and bank 
credit transactions. And, to create accurate and strong fraud detection models that handle the 
unique challenges of both types of transaction data. 
<h2>Task 1: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering</h2>

1. Data Loading
2. Handle Missing Values
3. Data Cleaning
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
6. Feature Engineering
7. Normalization and Scaling
8. Encode Categorical Features

<h2>Task 2: Model Training and Evaluation</h2>

1. Data Splitting
-Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
-80/20 split is used.
2. Model Selection
-Choose machine learning algorithms that are suitable for the problem. Common choices for classification tasks include.
    -Logistic Regression
    -Decision Trees
    -Random Forests
    -Gradient Boosting Machines
    -MLP
2. Training
-Train the selected models using the training data.
3. Evaluation
-Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using metrics such as
    -Accuracy
    -Precision
    -Recall
    -F1 Score
    
<h2>Task 3: Model Explanation with SHAP and LIME</h2>

Both SHAP and LIME offer different perspectives on model explainability. SHAP provides global feature importance, while LIME focuses on local explanations for individual predictions. Using these techniques together can gives a comprehensive understanding of the fraud detection model's behavior and decision-making process.
